My name is Jonathan Park. My background is in architecture, However, after 
getting my MBA I made a career change to a government/military contracting 
company. My career goals are to continue moving upwards into executive 
management. I chose to take this FinTech course primarily because I believe 
executive management for all businesses will need to have a FinTech related 
understanding and capability.
